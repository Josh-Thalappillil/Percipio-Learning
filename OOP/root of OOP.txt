Class is the root of all object-oriented programming


Class is made of attributes as well as functions.
- Attributes of class act like adjectives, they describe the class
- Accessed using the dot nation
- Can be modified
- No limits on attributes


Functions of a class.
- Perform a task
- No limits
- May accept parameters (values)
- May return a value


Constructor Function
- A constructor function is special - it assists in building an object that is ready to be used 
- It may take parameters, but it never returns anything
- Constructor functions will always exist, even if not explicity
